# Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains a customer segmentation project, aiming to analyze and classify customers based on their annual income and spending score. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, businesses can gain valuable insights into their target audience, personalize marketing strategies, and optimize customer experiences.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data` directory. This dataset serves as the foundation for the segmentation analysis.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Use a package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or conda) to install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment, if you set one up.

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `customer-segmentation.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for performing customer segmentation analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering algorithms, and visualization.

3. Customize the analysis as needed. Feel free to experiment with different clustering algorithms, feature selection techniques, or visualization methods to further enhance the segmentation results.

## Results

Upon executing the notebook, you will obtain the following outcomes:

- Customer Segmentation: The model will cluster customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and characteristics. These segments will provide insights into different customer groups and their unique attributes.

- Visualization: The notebook includes code to visualize the customer segments using various plots, such as scatter plots, bar charts, or heatmaps. These visualizations aid in understanding the characteristics of each segment.
